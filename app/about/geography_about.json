It provides students with a broad-based, research-led education and is one of the few academic Departments that synthesizes ideas and information from the geosciences, environment, economics, politics, society and culture. In a world characterized by rapid environmental change, our research and teaching adopt an holistic approach towards understanding our complex and diverse planet.
