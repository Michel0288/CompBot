    "responses": ["In 1949, the Faculty of Natural Sciences was added to the named University College of the West Indies. The Department of Mathematics was one of the first added department to be a part of Faculty of Natural Sciences then. Since receiving its independent degree granting university status in 1962, as the University of the West Indies, the faculty and the Department have evolved significantly.  We now offer six undergraduate programmes, two taught M.Sc. programmes as well as MPhil and PhDs. We have now evolved our teaching through the use of technological software to enhance teaching while bringing the world to our students at a click.\\n\\nWe have produced many distinguished Jamaicans such as Professor the Hon. Leslie Robinson who has served the Mona Campus with distinction, we also produced various Ministers in Government as well as Rhode Scholars.\\n\\nWe will therefore continue our mandate aimed at engaging mathematically talented students and provide for them academically cogent programmes, which mirror research interests of staff, and produce first class students capable of moving nations to higher levels of economic growth and development."]
