# CompBot

 The CompBot project is a chatbot focused on giving students information about the Faculty of Science and Technology at the UWI MONA. It is a great tool to use when students have questions about the faculty without the hassle of sending a plethora of emails or going in person to speak to someone from the faculty.

1. Remember to always create a virtual environment and install the packages in your requirements file

```bash
python -m venv venv (you may need to use python3 instead)
source venv/bin/activate (or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt 

```

2. Install the required libraries
```bash
pip install nltk
pip install numpy
pip install keras
pip install tensorflow
```
3. Run the main.py file to create the model
```bash
python3 main.py
```

3. Run the chat.py file to chat
